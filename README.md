# Stm32-based-accelerometer-controlled-RCcar
This project uses STM32F103C8 as a  Microcontroller, the RC car moves in the direction that of the smartphone is tilted. 
Here HC05 Bluetooth module is to communicate between the smartphone and STM32 microcontroller. L298N is used as a motor driver to drive 4-6 volts rated four motors.
